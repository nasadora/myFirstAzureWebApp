Quickstart: Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to create and deploy your first ASP.NET Core web app to Azure App Service.

When you're finished, you'll have an Azure resource group consisting of an App Service hosting plan and an App Service with a deployed web application.

Prerequisites
An Azure account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.

This quickstart deploys an app to App Service on Windows. To deploy to App Service on Linux, see Create a .NET Core web app in App Service.

Install Visual Studio 2019 with the ASP.NET and web development workload.

If you've installed Visual Studio 2019 already:

- Install the latest updates in Visual Studio by selecting Help > Check for Updates.
- Add the workload by selecting Tools > Get Tools and Features.
